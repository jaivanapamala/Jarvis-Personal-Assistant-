#Virtual Assistant Project

Welcome to the Virtual Assistant project! This repository contains the codebase for a feature-rich virtual assistant built using Python and integrated with a modern web interface using Eel. The assistant leverages several powerful Python libraries and tools to perform voice-based interactions, execute tasks, and provide intelligent assistance.

##Features

##Core Functionalities
1. Hotword Detection:
    Utilizes pvporcupine for keyword-based wake word detection.
    Responds to hotwords "Jarvis" or "JD."
2. Voice Recognition:
    Processes user commands using speech_recognition and Google Speech API.
   
3. Text-to-Speech:
    Converts assistant responses to speech using pyttsx3 for natural interaction.

4. Task Execution:
    Plays music and videos on YouTube using pywhatkit.
    Opens websites and performs Google searches via webbrowser.
    Tells jokes using pyjokes.
    Real-Time Multithreading:

Handles hotword detection and voice command processing in parallel using threading for smooth operation.

##Frontend Integration
1.  Eel is used to bridge the Python backend with an interactive web frontend.
2.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provide a user-friendly interface to complement the voice commands.

#Tech Stack

##Backend
1.   Python: Core programming language.

   
##Libraries Used:
     pvporcupine: Hotword detection.
     pyaudio: Capturing microphone input.
     pyttsx3: Text-to-speech conversion.
     speech_recognition: Voice-to-text processing.
     pywhatkit: Automating YouTube playback and more.
     webbrowser: Opening web pages and performing searches.
     pyjokes: Generating random jokes.


#How It Works

##Startup:
    The assistant initializes the required libraries and services.
    Hotword detection is activated using pvporcupine.

##Hotword Activation:
    The assistant continuously listens for predefined hotwords like "Jarvis."
    Upon detecting a hotword, it activates the speech recognition module.
    
##Command Processing:
    User voice input is converted to text using speech_recognition.
    The assistant processes the command and determines the appropriate action (e.g., playing music, telling jokes, or opening websites).

##Response:
    The assistant responds with speech using pyttsx3.
    Task outputs (e.g., search results) are also displayed on the web interface.

##Frontend Interaction:
    Users can also interact with the assistant via text commands in the web interface.
    The frontend provides real-time updates and feedback.
